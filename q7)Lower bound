Problem Statement:

You are given an array 'arr' sorted in non-decreasing order and a number 'x'

You must return the index of lower bound of 'x'.

public class Solution {
    public static int lowerBound(int []arr, int n, int x) {
        int start=0;
        int end= arr.length-1;
        int answer=n;
        while(start<=end){
            int mid =(start+end)/2;
//maybe na answer
            if(arr[mid]>=x){
                answer=mid;
                end=mid-1; //look for more small index on left
            }
            else{
                start=mid+1;   //look for right
            }
        }
        return answer;
    }
}
